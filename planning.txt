Most basic:
1. User input GitHub repo 
2. Git ingest processes it
3. Scrape from gitingest send to agent 
4. Agent “learns it”
5. Spin up chat ability 
6. Ideally have elevenlabs + Whisper so you can speak to it


Extra: 
1. Guided tour from beginning
2. Voice based navigation?


- Cursor only has context for couple files
- Cursor only sees current code (not the choices made in commit)
- Speaking is faster/more efficient.




Look at repo different periods of time:
1.  user inputs query,
2. look at commit messages to find most relevant changes for that function
3.  parse repo at those points with git ingest
4. Do like rag? for analysis .
